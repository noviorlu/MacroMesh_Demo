This report presents the development of a real-time ClusterLOD Renderer designed for efficient rendering of large-scale scenes 
with complex geometry. The project addresses challenges in maintaining high visual fidelity, optimizing performance, and 
reducing memory usage, leveraging modern GPU techniques. Key methods include mesh partitioning, Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) simplification.
\customnewline
The motivation for this work stems from significant advancements in game engine technologies in recent years, particularly the 
introduction of Nanite and Lumen in Unreal Engine 5 in 2020. Nanite revolutionized mesh handling by enabling the efficient 
loading and use of massive geometry data in real-time scenes, while Lumen focused on indirect global illumination, delivering 
realistic lighting and reflections. While Lumen improves visual quality by simulating light transport, this project emphasizes 
addressing the challenges of rendering massive geometry datasets, akin to those targeted by Nanite.
\customnewline
This project primarily focuses on managing large-scale meshes by utilizing clustering techniques to achieve two core objectives:
first, to parallelize and accelerate the QEM simplification algorithm, enabling efficient precomputation of mesh levels of 
detail; second, to allow piecewise Level of Detail (LOD) selection instead of traditional whole-mesh LOD selection. These 
innovations make it possible to dynamically adjust detail levels across different parts of a scene, optimizing both performance 
and memory usage in real-time applications.
\customnewline
By combining clustering, hierarchical data structures, and a GPU-driven pipeline, this work advances the state-of-the-art in 
real-time rendering, making it well-suited for applications requiring high-quality visuals and efficient resource utilization.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The motivation for this project originates from the impressive advancements showcased by Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) in 2020, particularly 
the Tomb Raider Cave demo. This demo demonstrated the capability to render billions of triangles in a single frame, all in real-time. Inspired 
by this, I aim to develop a similar system capable of rendering large-scale scenes in real-time, enabling the creation of more complex and 
immersive environments in games, ultimately enhancing realism.
\customnewline
While UE5's Lumen focuses on real-time global illumination by combining multiple global illumination algorithms, it works by accumulating 
radiance over time. It employs a `renderSurfaceCache` to convert to and from VoxelSH spheres, achieving real-time results through temporal 
radiance accumulation. This allows Lumen to deliver highly realistic lighting in dynamic scenes.
\customnewline
Our project, however, focuses on Nanite, another groundbreaking technology introduced alongside Lumen. Nanite addresses the challenge of 
efficiently rendering vast numbers of triangles in large-scale scenes. Its core innovation lies in the ability to quickly select visible 
triangles and stream them into the GPU. This is essential for scenarios where scenes contain a high density of triangles but are viewed from 
a distance. In such cases, the resolution of the view often cannot match the scene's geometric detail, leading to significant overdraw, as 
multiple triangles may be rendered for a single pixel.
\customnewline
To solve this, an efficient Level of Detail (LOD) system is required. The LOD system dynamically adjusts the level of detail based on the 
viewpoint, reducing overdraw and improving rendering performance. This project aims to study and replicate these ideas, exploring how to 
implement a robust and efficient ClusterLOD rendering system.

\subsection{Goal}
The goal of this project is to develop a real-time ClusterLOD renderer for efficiently rendering large-scale scenes with complex geometries.
\customnewline
This problem can be divided into two main parts: precomputation and runtime pipeline. 
\customnewline
In the \textbf{precomputation} stage, the tasks include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mesh Partitioning:} Divide the mesh into multiple clusters, where each cluster represents a group of spatially adjacent triangles.
    \item \textbf{QEM Simplification:} Simplify the clusters using the Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) algorithm, reducing the number of 
    triangles while maintaining visual fidelity.
    \item \textbf{LOD Hierarchy Construction:} Repeat the above process iteratively to generate a Level of Detail (LOD) hierarchy. Finally, 
    build a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) to organize these LODs, enabling fast, compute-shader-based selection and streaming.
\end{enumerate}
In the \textbf{runtime pipeline}, the tasks include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{LOD Selection and Streaming:} Select and stream visible clusters dynamically based on the view frustum and screen-space 
    error metrics.
    \item \textbf{Visibility Buffer Implementation:} Implement a visibility buffer to assist with cluster culling. Inspired by UE5, this 
    involves using the visibility buffer from the previous frame to conservatively determine visible objects, followed by further culling 
    calculations for remaining clusters.
    \item \textbf{Deferred Shading Pipeline:} Integrate the visibility buffer into the deferred shading pipeline without disrupting its workflow.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Effects:} Implement advanced real-time effects, including Screen Space Reflections (SSR), Screen Space Ambient 
    Occlusion (SSAO), and Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA).
    \item \textbf{Post-Processing Effects:} Apply effects such as bloom, tone mapping, and color grading to enhance the final rendered image.
\end{enumerate}
By addressing both precomputation and runtime challenges, this project aims to create a high-performance ClusterLOD rendering system capable 
of handling the complexities of large-scale, detailed scenes in real-time.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\subsection{Existing Techniques}
Level of Detail (LOD) rendering is a critical technique for managing performance in real-time rendering. Various LOD methods have been 
developed to balance visual fidelity and computational cost. This section provides an overview of key LOD techniques:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discrete Level of Detail (DLOD):} Objects are preprocessed to generate multiple resolutions, such as high, medium, 
    and low LODs. The appropriate LOD is selected at runtime based on the viewer's distance. While simple and efficient, this method 
    may suffer from popping artifacts during transitions. This is generally generated by the artist and is not dynamic.

    \item \textbf{Continuous Level of Detail (CLOD):} Instead of predefined levels, geometry is simplified dynamically in real-time, 
    ensuring smooth transitions. This approach is commonly used in terrain rendering, such as the ROAM algorithm, but requires higher 
    computational effort.

    \item \textbf{Screen Space Error Metrics:} This method uses the projected size of objects on the screen to dynamically adjust LOD. 
    By measuring pixel coverage, this technique ensures optimal resource allocation and minimizes overdraw.

    \item \textbf{Cluster-Based LOD:} Introduced in Unreal Engine 5 as Nanite, this technique divides models into clusters and generates 
    multi-level LODs. GPU-based parallel processing enables fast selection and streaming of visible clusters, making it suitable for 
    large-scale, highly detailed scenes.

    \item \textbf{Image-Based LOD (Billboarding):} Objects far from the camera are replaced with 2D textures mapped onto planes, 
    significantly reducing geometry complexity. This technique is widely used for rendering vegetation and distant objects in large scenes.

    \item \textbf{Geometry Shaders for LOD:} Geometry shaders dynamically adjust the level of detail during rendering. Although 
    flexible, this approach may face performance bottlenecks for highly detailed models.
\end{enumerate}
Each of these techniques offers unique advantages and trade-offs. In this project, we focus on Cluster-Based LOD to handle large-scale 
scenes with high geometric complexity, inspired by Nanite's efficient cluster-based streaming and selection pipeline.

\subsection{Relevant Concepts}

This section provides an overview of the key concepts used in this project: mesh partitioning, QEM simplification, and Bounding Volume 
Hierarchy (BVH).

\subsubsection{Mesh Partitioning}
Mesh partitioning is the process of dividing a mesh into smaller, spatially coherent clusters. This is essential for efficient processing
and management of complex geometries in real-time rendering. One common approach is to use graph partitioning algorithms, such as 
those implemented in the METIS library. METIS works by representing the mesh as a graph, where vertices correspond to mesh elements 
(e.g., triangles) and edges represent adjacency relationships. By minimizing the edge cut between partitions, METIS ensures that 
clusters are spatially cohesive, which is critical for Level of Detail (LOD) systems and BVH construction.

\subsubsection{QEM Simplification}

Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) simplification is a widely-used algorithm for reducing the complexity of a mesh while preserving its 
visual fidelity. The core idea is to iteratively collapse edges by combining two vertices into one, minimizing the geometric error 
introduced by the operation. This section describes the steps of the QEM simplification algorithm and formulates the edge collapse 
operation mathematically.
\paragraph{Steps of QEM Simplification:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize Error Matrices:}
    For each vertex \(v_i\) in the mesh, calculate its associated quadric error matrix \(Q_i\). This matrix is defined based on the 
    sum of the squared distances to the planes of all triangles adjacent to \(v_i\):
    \[
    Q_i = \sum_{p \in \text{adjacent planes}} \mathbf{k}_p \mathbf{k}_p^T
    \]
    where \(\mathbf{k}_p = [a, b, c, d]^T\) is the plane equation \(ax + by + cz + d = 0\) normalized for each triangle plane adjacent 
    to \(v_i\). This 4 by 4 matrix can be used to calculate the distance from a point to a plane derived from \cite{Garland1997}.


    \item \textbf{Select Candidate Edges:}
    Identify all edges in the mesh that are candidates for collapsing. An edge is defined by two vertices \(v_i\) and \(v_j\).

    \item \textbf{Compute Collapse Cost:}
    For each edge \((v_i, v_j)\), calculate the combined quadric error matrix:
    \[
    Q_{ij} = Q_i + Q_j
    \]
    The optimal new position \(v'\) is computed by minimizing the quadric error:
    \[
    \text{Error}(v') = v'^T Q_{ij} v'
    \]
    where \(v' = [x, y, z, 1]^T\). To find the position \(v'\) that minimizes this error, the following steps are taken:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Represent \(Q_{ij}\) as:
        \[
        Q_{ij} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        A & b \\
        b^T & c
        \end{bmatrix}
        \]
        where \(A\) is a \(3 \times 3\) matrix, \(b\) is a \(3 \times 1\) vector, and \(c\) is a scalar.
        \item Solve for \(v'\) if \(A\) is invertible:
        \[
        v' = -A^{-1} b
        \]
        \item If \(A\) is singular (not invertible), choose \(v'\) as one of the following:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Vertex \(v_i\),
            \item Vertex \(v_j\),
            \item The midpoint of \((v_i, v_j)\): \(\frac{v_i + v_j}{2}\).
        \end{itemize}
        Compare the quadric error values at these candidate positions and select the one with the smallest error.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Edge Collapse Error:}
    The quadric error associated with collapsing an edge \((v_i, v_j)\) is defined as:
    \[
    \text{Error}(v') = v'^T Q_{ij} v'
    \]
    where \(Q_{ij}\) is the combined quadric matrix of \(v_i\) and \(v_j\). This error represents the deviation of the simplified surface from the original.

    \item \textbf{Collapse Edge:}
    Collapse the edge \((v_i, v_j)\) into the new vertex \(v'\). Update the mesh connectivity and recompute affected triangles to reflect the collapse.

    \item \textbf{Repeat Until Target Simplification:}
    Continue collapsing edges with the lowest cost until the target number of triangles or the desired error threshold is reached.

\end{enumerate}

By iteratively applying the steps described above, QEM simplifies the mesh while maintaining its essential geometric features, 
making it an ideal choice for real-time LOD rendering.
 

\subsubsection{Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)}
A Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is a tree-like data structure used to organize objects in a 3D space. Each node in the BVH contains 
a bounding volume (e.g., an axis-aligned bounding box) that encapsulates a subset of the scene's geometry. BVHs are widely used in 
real-time rendering for tasks like frustum culling, ray tracing, and LOD selection. By hierarchically grouping objects, BVHs enable 
efficient spatial queries and reduce the computational cost of rendering. In the context of ClusterLOD, BVHs are constructed to 
organize LOD levels, allowing for fast selection and streaming of visible clusters based on the view frustum and screen-space error 
metrics.

These concepts—mesh partitioning, QEM simplification, and BVH—form the foundation of the ClusterLOD system implemented in this project, 
enabling efficient processing and rendering of large-scale scenes.
